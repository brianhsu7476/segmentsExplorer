	<h1>Segments Explorer</h1>
	<p><b>Use <a href='map.html'>Segments Explorer</a> and become a segments conqueror.</b></p>
	<p>If you love this project, please give me a star <a href='https://github.com/brianhsu7476/segmentsExplorer' target='_blank'>here.</a></p>
	<p>I have heard many cyclists complain that Strava's segment-finding feature is really hard to use,<br>
	so I developed this website to help you find the segments you like.</p>
	<p><b><font style='color:red'>New feature: </font>If you're having trouble making a decision, you can press the R key or the button in the bottom-right corner,<br>and Segments Explorer will randomly pick a segment for you.</b></p>
	<p>Go and conquer the segments. Good luck and have fun.</p>
	<p>If the segment you are looking for is not listed, feel free to contact me.</p>
