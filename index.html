	<p>If you love this project, please give me a star <a href='https://github.com/brianhsu7476/segmentsExplorer' target='_blank'>here.</a></p>
	<p>I have heard many cyclists complain that Strava's segment-finding feature is really hard to use,<br>
	so I developed this website to help you find the segments you like.
